# Suggestions
* Hybrid skills (e.g., some skill calculation is based on `Assess Creature` + `TH` to incentivize build diversity)
* Custom spells / spell schools.  Possibly working with something like the hybrid skills.
  * Ways to make use of extra mana/mana conversion via enhanced casting (e.g., 1.1x damage, 2x cost)
* Dungeons that temporarily set you to lvl 1 (or the level you last were inside them)
  * Planned to base this on godmode.  Might have some issues with the jkurs/the other server code is done.
  * Maybe experiment with adding dungeon-specific gear
* Replace spawning of corpses to a "loot xp" that can be used in a more flexible manner.
  * Potential for a lot less server overhead by removing the need to spawn items/keep corpses
  * Players can focus on just hunting
  * Quality of loot is abstracted in a way that makes it easier to create content?  Matching growth of `lp` with `xp` lets you focus on the cashout mechanism.
    * Additionally makes it easier to have alternative currencies, if kills in different areas gave different
* Weenie templating tools
  * e.g., generate weenies based on a creature template for each damage type, in increments of 50 levels up to X
* Global Server/Guild vassals
  * Some/all players add a fraction of XP to a pool that is at some interval split amongst all players on the server/their guild. 
  * Good catch-up mechanic for newer players that could be scaled to be insignificant to the higher levels.
  * Opportunity for collaborative events/content 
* Traps to trigger custom commands, keeping context
* Achievements
  * Increment weenie killed
* Personal bests / records
  * Start timer, check progress made at the end.
  * Maybe using achievements, let players try to set a "PB" that is used for a reward or idle benefits
* Dire-er Lands
  * Scale spawns based on distance from X up to Y
* Super-rares
  * Possibly with fuzzed names to cause issues with metas
